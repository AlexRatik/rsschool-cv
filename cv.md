### Hello! My name is Alexandr. You are can contact with me by write me messages in Discord **(Alex_Ra#8132)**.
Let me tell you a bit information about myself, my goals, strong sides. I am from Oshmyany, it is a small city with population around 10.000 people.  I wasn’t born in a rich family, but I can’t say that my family was a poor. I have an elder brother, he is 31 now. He is the most important human in my life. It is he who always help me in the most difficult situations and always support me, for which I’m very grateful for him. He pushed me to the path of programmer. I did little projects for myself, and I think that now I already have a base, I want to structure it and get my first job.
- I can write some web application using ___HTML, CSS(SCSS), JS(TS)___.
- This is example of code of binary search: 
- _`function findIndex(array, value) {  
  let first = 0;  
  let last = array.length - 1;  
  let between = Math.round(last / 2);  
  while (array[between] !== value && first < last) {  
    if (array[between] < value) {  
      first = between + 1;  
    } else if (array[between] > value) {  
      last = between - 1;  
    }  
    between = Math.round((first + last) / 2);  
  }  
  return Math.abs(between);  
}`_   
- I did courses on Udemy.com, which I finished successfully.
- I am studying in BSUIR. There are lectures and seminars on programming.
- I rate my English as **A2** level.
