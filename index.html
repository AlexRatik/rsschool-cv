                <p class="about_myself">
                    Let me tell you a bit information about myself, my goals,
                    strong sides. I am from Oshmyany, it is a small city with
                    population around 10.000 people. I wasn’t born in a rich
                    family, but I can’t say that my family was a poor. I have an
                    elder brother, he is 31 now. He is the most important human
                    in my life. It is he who always help me in the most
                    difficult situations and always support me, for which I’m
                    very grateful for him. He pushed me to the path of
                    programmer. I did little projects for myself, and I think
                    that now I already have a base, I want to structure it and
                    get my first job.
