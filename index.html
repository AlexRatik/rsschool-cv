                        <h4>
                            Let me tell you a bit information about myself, my
                            goals, strong sides. I am from Oshmyany, it is a
                            small city with population around 10.000 people. I
                            wasn’t born in a rich family, but I can’t say that
                            my family was a poor. I have an elder brother, he is
                            31 now. He is the most important human in my life.
                            It is he who always help me in the most difficult
                            situations and always support me, for which I’m very
                            grateful for him. He pushed me to the path of
                            programmer. I did little projects for myself, and I
                            think that now I already have a base, I want to
                            structure it and get my first job.
